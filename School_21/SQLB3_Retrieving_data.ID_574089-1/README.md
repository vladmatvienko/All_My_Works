## _Deep diving into JOINs in SQL_

In this project, you'll master essential SQL and relational database skills: understanding relational algebra, using different JOIN operations, writing queries with CTEs, handling NULL values, and filtering/sorting data. 

These competencies will prove valuable in development, database optimization, analytics, and programming—empowering you to work with data efficiently and make data-driven decisions.

## How to learn at «School 21»

- Here, you’ll find a unique learning experience with a lot of freedom. You’re given a task and left to find your own way to solve it, using whatever resources work best for you — whether that’s the Internet or AI tools like GigaChat. Just be mindful of information quality: verify, think critically, analyze, and compare.
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning is the exchange of knowledge and experience with peers, where everyone acts as both mentor and student. This approach allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the material by learning from one another.
- Feel free to ask for help: around you are peers who are also navigating this path for the first time. Share your own experience and ideas with others.  Join Rocket.Chat to stay updated with the latest community announcements. 
- Your learning is meaningless if you just copy someone else’s solutions. When receiving help from others, always make sure you fully understand the “why”, “how”, and “purpose” behind the solution. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. 
- Does the task seem impossible? Take a break, get some fresh air and clear your mind — this has helped many people. Maybe after that, the solution will come to you naturally.
- The learning process is just as important as the result. It’s not just about completing the task — it’s about understanding HOW to solve it. 

How to work with the project:

- Before starting, clone the project from GitLab into a repository with the same name.
- All files should be created inside the _src/_ folder of the cloned repository.
- After cloning the project, create a _develop_ branch and do all your development there. Then, push the _develop_ branch to GitLab.
- Your directory should not contain any files other than those specified in the assignments.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D02_01](misc/images/D02_01.png)

The image shows a Relational Expression in Tree View. This expression corresponds to the following SQL query:

    SELECT *
        FROM R CROSS JOIN S
    WHERE clause

In other words, we can describe any SQL in the mathematical language of Relational Algebra.

You may ask: "Why do we need to learn Relational Algebra in a course if we can write a SQL in the first attempt?". 
The answer is yes and no at the same time. 
"Yes" means that you can write a SQL from the first attempt, that's right
"No" means that you need to know the main aspects of Relational Algebra, because this knowledge is used for optimization plans and for semantic queries. 
What kind of joins exist in Relational Algebra?
Actually, "Cross Join" is a primitive operator and it is an ancestor for other types of joins.
- Natural Join,
- Theta Join,
- Semi Join,
- Anti Join,
- Left/Right/Full Joins. 

But what is a join operation between 2 tables? Let me present a part of pseudo code how join operation works without indexing.

    FOR r in R LOOP
        FOR s in S LOOP
        if r.id = s.r_id then add(r,s)
        …
        END;
    END;

It’s just a set of loops ... Not magic at all


## Chapter II
## Rules of the day

- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore' to avoid accidents. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.
